# nais-cli

nais-cli is a simple CLI application that developers in NAV can use to debug NAIS-[Costume Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). The tool uses a go library [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to create a simple
interface like modern CLI, that is similar to git & go tools.

If you want to know more about the tool and commands, please visit and read
the [github repository](https://github.com/nais/nais-cli) documentation.
